# Currency Exchange Rate application using Flutter + GetIt + Dio

## Descriptions
üëã Hey there!

As part of my Flutter course, I developed an app for some practice. I used Bloc as state manager and GetIt for dependency injection and Dio requests. Overall, I'm pretty excited about how this project turned out and I hope you will enjoy it too! ‚ù§Ô∏è
